  PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  A fun project, this one focuses on a quiz that consists of a set of question-answer pairs.
The questions and answers will be stored in a JSON file and grouped by categories. We will 
have the following categories: Football, Culture, Music, Economics, Geography, and Computer 
Science. Each category contains 25 questions, and for each question, there will be 3 or 4 answer 
options (one of the proposed answers is correct). 
When a player accesses the Web quiz application, they will see a welcome page and a set of 
categories. When they choose a category, the application will display information about the 
category (image, description, and game rules). 
For each category, there are 3 difficulty levels: "Mougou", "Don Man", "Tara". Note that the 
difficulty of a question series is relative to the chosen level. Thus, for each level, we will have 
a list of players ready for a game. By selecting a player, the quiz will open for a new match. 
The quiz can then begin. The first player to answer will have their score increased by 3 points 
for a correct answer. If the answer is incorrect, the quiz moves on to the next question, and the 
score remains 0. 
At the end of the match, the score of the two players is displayed based on the chosen category 
and difficulty level. A player can decide to stop a game at any time, in which case they will be 
considered the loser with a total of 0 points. If a player defeats another player, their difficulty 
level will advance to the next one, for example: "Mougou" => "Don Man". The losing player 
will see their level decrease.
